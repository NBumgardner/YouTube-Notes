# YouTube Notes
Single-page web app for taking notes while watching YouTube playlists. Individually made as the CSC 590 project in Advanced Internet Programming.

## Build Steps
Run the following commands (requires the gulp-cli to be globally installed):

```
npm install
gulp
```

## Start the local dev server
```
npm start
```

## Description
This application has three views. They are meant to be used for taking notes while watching a YouTube video, or playlist of videos.

The outline of the application has been created, and the user can move between views, but the YouTube API calls have not yet been implemented. The buttons also need functions tied to them.
